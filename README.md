I am Sanaz Esmaeili.A PhD student at USF in Geophysics. I completed my undergrade in Physics in 2006 and my master in Geophysics in 2010. After my graduation beacuse of my deep intrest in computer programming I passed some courses in Visual Basic and SQL So I was hired as a software developer in a development and design of bank system company in Iran. I worked with VB6 which is an object oriented programming languase more than 3 years there.
In 2014, my husband was admitted as a PhD student at USF so we moved  in to Tampa. I improved my English and took IELTS and then I applied for a PhD position in USF. I've been admitted for Fall 2016.
